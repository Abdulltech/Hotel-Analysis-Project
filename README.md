Clone the project repository to your local machine.

Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.

Install the required dependencies, including pandas.

Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the project directory.

Open the "hotel_analysis-project.ipynb" notebook.

Execute the cells in the notebook to run the analysis.

## How to Use the Project

The Hotel Analysis Project provides insights into revenue generation and occupancy rates for hotels. To use the project effectively, follow these guidelines:

Ensure that all the required CSV files are available in the project directory.

Run the notebook cells sequentially to import the data and perform the analysis.

Review the analysis results and explore the provided visualizations.

Modify the analysis as needed, using the available data and pandas library functions.

Feel free to customize the notebook or add additional analysis sections based on your requirements.

## Key Achievement

The key achievement of the Hotel Analysis Project includes:
Determining the city with the highest and lowest revenue generation. The analysis revealed that Bangalore had the highest revenue, while Mumbai had the lowest.


## Data sources

The data source for the Hotel Analysis Project consists of six CSV files.

These CSV files contain the necessary data for analyzing hotel revenue and occupancy rates.

The files include data for four different cities and separate files for revenue and occupancy information.

Ensure that all six CSV files are available in the project directory to successfully run the analysis.
